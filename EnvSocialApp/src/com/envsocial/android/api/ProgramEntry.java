				"We define this model to the aim of adding to the PrivaCIAS framework a new layer that follows " +
				"the theory of contextual integrity in more depth. We describe in detail the implementation of a " +
				"proof of concept privacy-aware photo-sharing social network that we had developed for Android " +
				"smartphones. The social network was built on the extended PrivaCIAS framework, and thus illustrates " +
				"its applicability in helping users to preserve privacy.");
